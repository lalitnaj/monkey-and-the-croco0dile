These are high school short stories which are 
widely used by the high school students and high school teachers. 
Many of our visitors who are high school teachers
 and administrators have come to
 us seeking our permission to use these short
  stories in their classrooms to enhance the reading 
  capacity of their students. We have obliged them, 
  keeping their genuine demands in mind.
   When they use our materials for their students, 
   we feel respected. WE have decided to stand deserved 
   to feed their demands which are to improve the language-skills
    of their students. The students also have sought our 
    permission to use our materials in their school projects 
    which will fetch them more marks. WE are proud to say that
     our hard efforts are feeds the genuine demands of
      the students as well as the teachers.
